  ## Installation

  ## User Story
  AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

  ## Acceptance Criteria
  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

  ## Installation
  The user is advised to cd into the project folder using the bash terminal. The user must have node installed for this application to work. The user then must run an npm install to install the package.json. Once that is installed the user simply inputs the command "node index.js" in the terminal and the application will run
  ## Usage
  To use this application the user must follow installation instructions and then respond to the prompts in the terminal. The provided prompts will guide the user on what information to input in order for the SVG generator to work. Pressing the "enter" key at the end of the prompts will result in the generation of a custom SVG file along with a confirmation in the terminal
